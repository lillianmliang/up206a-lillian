Datasets

## UrbanDisplacement_LA.xlsx:
1. Gentrification and Displacement in Los Angeles
2.  This dataset includes census tracts in Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties. The final index is comprised of gentrification and sociodemographic indicators based on 2015 data from the American Community Survey. The data "shows whether each Census tract comprising these three Southern California counties gentrified between 1990 and 2000; gentrified between 2000 and 2015; gentrified during both of these periods; or exhibited characteristics of a “disadvantaged” tract that did not gentrify between 1990 and 2015."
I'm interested in looking into climate displacement in my project. I might use this data in identifying communities prone to displacement ('types' identified in this dataset include those susceptible to displacement, low-income households, at risk of gentrification, ongoing gentrification, and advanced gentrification).

## CALBRACE_SeaLevelRise.xlsx
1. Sea Level Rise-Prone Areas in CA
2. This dataset provided by the California Department of Public Health's CALBRACE initiative includes sea level rise data from 2009-2010 from Pacific Institute and U.S. Geological Survey. The data indicator is "% Population Living in 100-year flood zone and 55 inches of sea level rise", and includes racial/ethnic stratification.
I'm interested in looking into climate displacement in my project. I might use this data in identifying communities prone to sea level rise. In conjunction with the urban displacement dataset, this dataset might be able to identify communities with few resources to adapt or recover from a home loss due to sea level rise flooding event.

## CALBRACE_Wildfires.xlsx
1. Wildfire-prone Areas in CA
2. This dataset provided by the California Department of Public Health's CALBRACE initiative includes wildfire data from 2007 from CAL FIRE. The data indicator is "% Population Living in very high fire hazard severity zone", and includes racial/ethnic stratification.
