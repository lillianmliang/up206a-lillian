## About Me
I'm a first year Master of Urban and Regional Planning student at UCLA interested in sustainable and just climate adaptation. I studied general engineering and literature at Harvey Mudd College and recently served as a California Climate Action Corps fellow with California Fire Safe Council, where I helped develop wildfire vulnerability metrics and map community-led wildfire resilience organizations in CA. 

## Course Description
The goal of this course spatial data science is to expose students to the foundations of spatial data science using open-source mapping tools. A more detailed description of the course can be found here: https://github.com/yohman/21F-UP206A

## Personal Course Goals
In this class, I hope to focus my attention on how to clearly and effectively communicate spatial data; getting a sense of the landscape of open-source mapping tools; and gaining a critical understanding about what maps and spatial data science can responsibly be used for in urban planning spaces. I'm also excited to learn new technical skills!

## Project Ideas
I would be interested in doing a course project related to the impacts of climate change - Extreme heat, Drought, Floods, Storms, or Wildfire - on frontline communities. Some ideas include health impacts, climate displacement, and climate gentrification.
